Object of the Exercise:

Create functions to:

    Convert feet/inches into metres,
    Convert stones/pounds into kilograms,
    Calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) using the formula:
    BMI=Weight in kilogramsHeight in metres2
    BMI=Height in metres2Weight in kilograms​

Getting Started:

Before beginning, download and unzip the required file:

The provided workbook calculates someone's BMI (Body Mass Index) from imperial measurements.

    You can type your name into cell C2 to personalize your data.

Built-in Constants:

The workbook contains a module with predefined constants for convenience:

' Conversion rate: kilograms per pound
Const KgRate As Double = 0.45359237

' Number of pounds in a stone
Const PoundsInStone As Integer = 14

' Number of inches in a foot
Const InchesInFeet As Integer = 12

' Number of centimetres in an inch
Const CmsInInch As Double = 2.54

Even though you know there are 12 inches in a foot, using constants makes your code clearer.
Functions to Write:

    Convert feet and inches into metres
        Create a function that converts a height in feet and inches to metres.
        Use this function to calculate the value in cell C7.

    Convert stones and pounds into kilograms
        Create a function to convert a weight in stones and pounds to kilograms.
        Use this function for calculations in column E.

    Calculate BMI
        Write a function to calculate BMI using height (in metres) and weight (in kilograms):
        BMI=WeightHeight2
        BMI=Height2Weight​
        The result should display in the appropriate cells.

Additional Notes:

    A healthy BMI is typically between 20 and 25.
    A BMI over 25 is considered overweight.

Instructions for Saving:

Save the completed workbook as BMI.xlsx, then close it.

VBA answer key:

Option Explicit

' Constants
Const KgRate As Double = 0.45359237 ' Number of kg in one pound
Const PoundsInStone As Integer = 14 ' Number of pounds in one stone
Const InchesInFeet As Integer = 12 ' Number of inches in one foot
Const CmsInInch As Double = 2.54 ' Number of centimeters in one inch

' Function to convert feet and inches to meters
Function ConvertToMeters(feet As Integer, inches As Integer) As Double
    Dim totalInches As Integer
    totalInches = (feet * InchesInFeet) + inches
    ConvertToMeters = totalInches * CmsInInch / 100 ' Convert cm to meters
End Function

' Function to convert stones and pounds to kilograms
Function ConvertToKilograms(stones As Integer, pounds As Integer) As Double
    Dim totalPounds As Integer
    totalPounds = (stones * PoundsInStone) + pounds
    ConvertToKilograms = totalPounds * KgRate
End Function

' Function to calculate BMI
Function CalculateBMI(weightKg As Double, heightM As Double) As Double
        CalculateBMI = weightKg / (heightM ^ 2)
End Function
