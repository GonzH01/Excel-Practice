The goal of this exercise is to create a macro in Excel that loops through all worksheets representing continents in a workbook. The macro extracts the last capital city listed in each worksheet and compiles these cities into a new worksheet named Last Cities.

Key tasks include:

    Navigating each worksheet (except Last Cities) to find the bottom-most row in the first column (country name) and retrieving the adjacent cell (capital city).
    Storing these capital cities sequentially in the Last Cities worksheet.
    Ensuring the Last Cities worksheet columns are automatically resized to fit the content.

The resulting Last Cities worksheet will display a list of the last capital city from each continent worksheet in a clear and organized manner.

VBA answer key:
Sub ListLastCities()
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Dim lastCitiesWs As Worksheet
    Dim lastRow As Long
    Dim capitalCity As String
    Dim outputRow As Long
    
    ' Add a new worksheet for Last Cities if it doesn't already exist
    On Error Resume Next
    Set lastCitiesWs = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("Last Cities")
    If lastCitiesWs Is Nothing Then
        Set lastCitiesWs = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets.Add
        lastCitiesWs.Name = "Last Cities"
    End If
    On Error GoTo 0
    
    ' Clear existing content in Last Cities worksheet
    lastCitiesWs.Cells.Clear
    
    ' Initialize output row
    outputRow = 1
    
    ' Loop through all worksheets
    For Each ws In ThisWorkbook.Worksheets
        If ws.Name <> "Last Cities" Then
            ' Find the last row in the first column
            lastRow = ws.Cells(ws.Rows.Count, 1).End(xlUp).Row
            
            ' Get the capital city (cell to the right of the last country)
            capitalCity = ws.Cells(lastRow, 2).Value
            
            ' Write the capital city to the Last Cities worksheet
            lastCitiesWs.Cells(outputRow, 1).Value = capitalCity
            
            ' Move to the next row in Last Cities
            outputRow = outputRow + 1
        End If
    Next ws
    
    ' Autofit the columns in the Last Cities worksheet
    lastCitiesWs.Columns.AutoFit
    
End Sub
