The goal of this exercise is to analyze property data using a pivot table with calculated fields and grouping to generate insights.

Key tasks include:

    Create a blank pivot table based on the provided property data.
    Add a calculated field named Total Rooms, which sums the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and reception rooms, and display it in the pivot table.
    Group locations into two categories:
        Urban: Includes "Town" and "Village."
        Non-Urban: Includes "Countryside" and "Remote."
    Use the grouped location field to display the percentage contribution of each garden size to the total number of properties for Urban and Non-Urban locations by adjusting the pivot table's calculation.

The final pivot table will provide a breakdown of property data by location type, garden size, and the calculated field for Total Rooms. Save the workbook as Throw-er pivot chart.xlsx and close it.

Steps to Complete the Desired Pivot Table:

    1)Create the Pivot Table:
        Highlight the property data.
        Create a pivot table on the next sheet and assign it to a specific cell.

    2)Add a Calculated Field for Total Rooms:
        In the PivotTable Analyze tab, select Fields, Items & Sets, then Calculated Field.
        Name the new field Total Rooms.
        Enter the formula: =bedrooms + bathrooms + reception rooms.
        Press OK and drag the new field to the Values area.

    3)Convert Total Rooms to Percentages:
        Click the dropdown arrow on Sum of Total Rooms in the Values area.
        Select Value Field Settings, then go to the Show Values As tab.
        Choose % of Row Total and press OK.

    4)Add Locations and Garden Size:
        Drag Location to the Rows area.
        Drag Garden Size to the Columns area.

    5)Group Locations:
        Highlight Countryside and Remote in the Rows area, right-click, and select Group. Rename the group to Non-Urban.
        Similarly, group Town and Village, and rename the group to Urban.

This will create a pivot table displaying Total Rooms as percentages by Location (Urban/Non-Urban) and Garden Size.
